# EPgrammar-XLE

This repository contains the XLE grammar fragment for European Portuguese developed as part of my masterâ€™s thesis: A Theoretical and Computational Exploration of Pro-drop in Romance Languages

## Contents

- Grammar file
- Template file
- Test suite with grammatical and ungrammatical sentences
- Test suite results
- Test suite glossing

## Purpose

The grammar implements the phenomenon of pro-drop in European Portuguese within the framework of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). It shows how verbal morphology licenses subject omission and demonstrates how this analysis can be transferred to an executable grammar in the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE).

## Usage

To run the grammar, you need an installation of XLE.

- Install XLE 
- Download this repository
- Open the terminal and navigate to the repository folder
- Start XLE
- Run create-parser EPgrammar.lfg to load the grammar

You can now parse the sentences from the test suite.

## Citation

The grammar is based on work within the ParGram project:
 
Butt, Miriam, Helge Dyvik, Tracy Holloway King, Hiroshi Masuichi & Christian Rohrer. 2002. The parallel grammar project.
